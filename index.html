                <ul>
                    <li>1332 - Born in Tunis, Hafsid Sultanate of Ifriqiya</li>
                    <li>1248 - His family emgrated to Tunis after the fall of Ishbiliya</li>
                    <li>Being from a high ranking family he received a quality education. Some of the best teachers in the city were recruited to tutor him and he learned grammar, jurisprudence, hadith, rhetoric, philology, and poetry. His classical Islamic education also included studying the Qur'an which he memorized by heart. He received certification (ijazah) for all these subjects.</li>
                    <li>He also received lessons in mathematics and philosophy from the famed Al-Abili of Tlemcen, who also taught him logic and introduced him to the works of Averroes, Avicenna, Razi and Tusi.</li>
                    <li>Tragedy struck the young boy’s family when both his parents perished during an intercontinental epidemic of the plague that hit Tunis in 1348–1349, leaving Ibn Khaldun orphaned at the age of 17.</li>
                    <li>Ibn Khaldun’s best known work is the ‘Muqaddimah’, also known as the ‘Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun’ which records an early view of universal history. The work is regarded by some modern thinkers as the first work dealing with the philosophy of history or the social sciences of sociology, demography, historiography, cultural history, social darwinism, marxism, and economics.</li>
                    <li>His famous works:
